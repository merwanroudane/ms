Interactive Statistical Distributions is an advanced educational tool developed by Dr. Merwan Roudane to facilitate a deeper understanding of discrete probability distributions within academic and professional settings. Leveraging the Streamlit framework, this application provides an interactive platform for exploring fundamental statistical concepts, such as the Bernoulli and Binomial distributions, through real-time parameter manipulation and sophisticated visualizations. Designed to support pedagogy and research, it enables users to examine probability mass functions, compute distributional properties, and visualize theoretical outcomes, making it an invaluable resource for students, instructors, and researchers in the field of statistics and probability theory
